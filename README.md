This is a simple budget tracker made with HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript.

- Click **Add Income** to add money you earn.
- Click **Add Expense** to add money you spend.
- The app automatically updates:
  - Total Income
  - Total Expenses
  - Total Budget (Income - Expenses)

## Features

- Stores income and expenses in arrays
- Uses basic input validation
- Styled using SASS with variables and a gradient mixin
